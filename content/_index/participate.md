##### Overview
This conference will expand on the theoretical and practical understandings of vulnerabilities inherent to ML systems, explore the robustness of ML algorithms and systems, and aid in developing a unified, coherent scientific community which aims to build trustworthy ML systems.

We solicit research papers, systematization of knowledge papers, and position
papers (see [Call for Papers](/participate-cfp) for details).

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
* Trustworthy data curation
* Novel attacks on ML systems
* Methods for defending against attacks on ML systems
* Forensic analysis of ML systems
* Verifying properties of ML systems
* Securely and safely integrating ML into systems
* Privacy (e.g., confidentiality, inference privacy, machine unlearning)
* Fairness
* Accountability
* Transparency
* Interpretability
