#### Overview
This conference will expand on the theoretical and practical understandings of vulnerabilities inherent to machine learning (ML), explore the robustness of learning algorithms and systems, and aid in developing a unified, coherent scientific community which aims to establish trustworthy machine learning. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Novel attacks on machine learning
* Novel defenses for machine learning
* Secure and safe machine learning in practice
* Verification of algorithms and systems
* Privacy in machine learning
* Forensic analysis of machine learning
* Fairness and interpretability
* Trustworthy data curation

We solicit research papers, systematization of knowledge papers, and position
papers (see [Call for Papers](/participate-cfp) for details). Furthermore, we invite proposals for our competition track (see [Call for Competitions](/participate-cfc) for details).

#### Venue
