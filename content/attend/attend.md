##### SaTML code of conduct

**IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML)** is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Sexual images in public spaces.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
* Harassing photography or recording.
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
* Inappropriate physical contact.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Offensive comments related to age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, national origin, race, religion, gender, sexual or affectional orientation, gender identity, gender expression, appearance, matriculation, political affiliation, marital status, veteran status.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

###### Enforcement

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event spaces—i.e., virtual conference platform, hotel venue, and event-related social spaces. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too! Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want to provide a safe, inclusive environment at our event. And people who report unacceptable behavior help us cultivate a safe and inclusive environment.

**To make a report:** [Email the general chair](mailto:contact@satml.org).

When taking a personal report, we will ensure you are in a safe environment and cannot be overheard. We may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once in a safe environment, we will ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we will handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.

If you are being harassed by a member of the SaTML community outside event spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by community members seriously. This includes harassment outside event spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. Consequences

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, they may be sanctioned or
expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.
Further action may be taken by IEEE in accordance with its policies covering
code of conduct (9.25 Civility Policy, 9.26 Policy Against Discrimination and
Harassment), whose consequences may include expulsion from membership in the
IEEE; see the [IEEE
policies](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/corporate/ieee-policies.pdf),
[IEEE Technical Activities
procedures](https://ta.ieee.org/images/files/ta_ops_manual.pdf) and the [IEEE
Member Code of
Conduct](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf)
for more information on these further IEEE actions.

##### Open conference statement

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion are central to the goals of the IEEE Computer Society and all of its conferences. 
* Equity at its heart is about removing barriers, biases, and obstacles that impede equal access and opportunity to succeed. 
* Diversity is fundamentally about valuing human differences and recognizing diverse talents. 
* Inclusion is the active engagement of Diversity and Equity.

A goal of the IEEE Computer Society is to foster an environment in which all individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer Society activity free of discrimination. For this reason, the IEEE Computer Society is firmly committed to team compositions in all sponsored activities, including but not limited to, technical committees, steering committees, conference organizations, standards committees, and ad hoc committees that display Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion. 

IEEE Computer Society meetings, conferences and workshops must provide a
welcoming, open and safe environment, that embraces the value of every person,
regardless of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or
expression, age, marital status, religion, national origin, ancestry, or
disability. All individuals are entitled to participate in any IEEE Computer
Society activity free of discrimination, including harassment based on any of
the above factors.

##### Event conduct and safety statement
IEEE believes that science, technology, and engineering are fundamental human activities, for which openness, international collaboration, and the free flow of talent and ideas are essential. Its meetings, conferences, and other events seek to enable engaging, thought provoking conversations that support IEEE’s core mission of advancing technology for humanity. Accordingly, IEEE is committed to providing a safe, productive, and welcoming environment to all participants, including staff and vendors, at IEEE-related events. 

IEEE has no tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or bullying in any form at IEEE-related events. All participants have the right to pursue shared interests without harassment or discrimination in an environment that supports diversity and inclusion. 
Participants are expected to adhere to these principles and respect the rights of others.

IEEE seeks to provide a secure environment at its events. Participants should report any behavior inconsistent with the principles outlined here, to on site staff, security or venue personnel, or to [eventconduct@ieee.org](mailto:eventconduct@ieee.org)
