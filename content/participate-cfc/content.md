#### Competition Track

The SaTML 2025 conference will feature a competition track. We invite proposals for competitions on topics that advance trustworthy and secure machine learning. The results of these competitions will be presented and discussed by participants and organizers at the conference. Further details on the organization will be released in the following months.

We particularly encourage proposals from fields that have a demonstrable positive societal impact, especially those utilizing AI to support disadvantaged communities. Additionally, we seek submissions in areas where machine learning can significantly benefit scientific, technological, or business domains. Our goal is to curate a series of competitions that will attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of participants, fostering collaboration and innovation across sectors.

We will focus on **data science competitions**, where participants will compete to achieve the highest score on a machine learning task relevant to the community. These tasks will be based on well-defined problems and corresponding data sets provided by the competition organizers.

#### Proposal Submission

Proposals for competitions at SaTML must be submitted via email to [contact@satml.org](mailto:contact@satml.org)

To ensure a swift review process, we will accept submissions with a maximum length of **three pages** only. This limit reduces the reviewers' workload and aids in timely assessments of all proposals.

#### Reviewing and selection process

Proposals will be evaluated based on factors such as:

* **Task(s)**: Impact, originality, relevance to the SaTML community will all be considered. Tasks that will foster positive societal impact are highly encouraged, although other topics relevant to the SaTML community are also welcomed.

* **Evaluation Protocol**: Feasibility of the task chosen, sufficient data for training and testing algorithms to solve the proposed task, soundness of the evaluation criteria, and clarity and fairness of the competition rules will all be evaluated.

* **Logistics**: The competition schedule, plan for attracting competition participants, and experience and diversity of the organizers will all be considered. The specific plan for attracting competition participants, including groups under-represented at SaTML, will be important during the review process.

#### Important dates and timeline

The competition track includes the following dates:

* Competition proposal deadline: **August 7, 2024**
* Acceptance notification: **August 16, 2024**
* Competition track (during the conference): **April 9-11, 2025**

Competition organizers should propose a timeline for running the competition to ensure participants have enough time to contribute high-quality entries. It is recommended that competitions be completed by **early March 2025** (one month prior to the SaTML conference) at the absolute latest.

#### Contact and help

Competition organizers that require help or suggestions regarding competition platforms for running the competition can contact [contact@satml.org](mailto:contact@satml.org) for advice. This call for competitions is adapted from the NeurIPS competition track.
