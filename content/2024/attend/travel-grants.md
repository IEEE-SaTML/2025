The conference will be using the generous support we received from our sponsors
to support researchers traveling to IEEE SaTML 2024 who do not have sufficient
funding. If you would like to apply to this travel award program, please fill
[this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMqUfw_It_SQ7doijcU3NX8DxyqiZY_pg45R26y_ZleGWT7w/viewform)
and we will get back to you if selected.

**Deadline:** We encourage applications by December 20, 2023 but applications
received after this date will be considered if funding is still available.
