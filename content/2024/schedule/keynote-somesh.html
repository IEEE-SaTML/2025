		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1> Generative AI (GenAI) Turing test (did the content originate from
		a model, such as DALLE, Gemini, Claude,...?) is an important primitive for several downstream tasks, such as
		detecting fake media. Several legislations are also mandating that companies should watermark the content
		generated by their models. Several watermarking schemes exist in the literature. We will discuss a few of them.
		However, some very powerful attacks exist on the watermarking schemes. We also cover some of these attacks. We
		will then ponder the following question: what use cases are appropriate for watermarking? We will conclude with
		some future directions.

		Technology, New Delhi in Electrical Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon
		University under the supervision of Prof. Edmund Clarke (a Turing award winner). Currently, Somesh Jha is the
		Lubar Professor in the Computer Sciences Department at the University of Wisconsin (Madison). His work focuses
		on analysis of security protocols, survivability analysis, intrusion detection, formal methods for security, and
		analyzing malicious code. Recently, he has focused his interested on privacy and adversarial ML (AML). Somesh
		Jha has published several articles in highly-refereed conferences and prominent journals. He has won numerous
		best-paper and distinguished-paper awards. Prof. Jha is the fellow of the AAAS, ACM and IEEE.
