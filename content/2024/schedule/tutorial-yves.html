		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1> A year ago, ChatGPT surprised the world with its extraordinary
		language generation capabilities, quickly becoming one of the fastest adopted consumer products in history.
		Concerns were however quickly raised regarding the reliance of LLMs, developed by OpenAI or its competitors, on
		high-quality content that is often protected by copyright. In this talk, I will briefly describe the current
		legal landscape. I will then discuss the different technical approaches that have been proposed to detect the
		use of copyright-protected content by LLMs. I will first briefly discuss data provenance techniques, a set of
		tools to efficiently search very large datasets. I will then discuss techniques to audit trained models,
		inspired by previous work in the privacy literature: post-hoc document-level membership inference attacks, which
		relies on naturally occurring memorization, and copyright traps, the injection of unique and highly memorizable
		sequences in original content.

		Mathematics and Computer Science at Imperial College London. He currently is a Special Adviser on AI and Data
		Protection to E.C. Justice Commissioner Reynders and a Parliament-appointed expert to the Belgian Data
		Protection Agency (APD-GBA). In 2018-2019, he was a Special Adviser to E.C. Competition Commissioner Vestager
		co-authoring the Competition Policy for the Digital Era report. His research has been published in Science and
		Nature Communications and has enjoyed wide media coverage (BBC, CNN, New York Times, Wall Street Journal,
		Harvard Business Review, etc.). His work on the shortcomings of anonymization has appeared in reports of the
		World Economic Forum, FTC, European Commission, and the OECD. Yves-Alexandre worked for the Boston Consulting
		Group and acted as an expert for both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the United Nations. He received
		his PhD from MIT in 2015 and obtained, over a period of 6 years, an M.Sc. from UCLouvain in Applied Mathematics,
		an M.Sc. (Centralien) from Ecole Centrale Paris, an M.Sc. from KULeuven in Mathematical Engineering as well as
		his B.Sc. in engineering from UCLouvain.
