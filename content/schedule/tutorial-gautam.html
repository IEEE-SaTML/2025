		<br>
		<br>

		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1> Differential privacy is a rigorous framework for
		privacy-preserving data analysis. It is widely adopted in both theory
		and practice, including deployments at Google, Apple, Microsoft, and the
		US Census Bureau. This tutorial will cover the basics of differential
		privacy, including the definition, basic properties, fundamental
		algorithms and building blocks, and applications to machine learning.
		Time permitting, recent trends in differential privacy research may also
		be highlighted.
