		<br>
		<br>
		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</h1> How do we communicate with AI Agents that learn? One obvious
		answer is via language. Indeed, humans have evolved languages over tens of thousands of years to provide useful
		abstractions for understanding and interacting with each other and with the physical world. The claim advanced
		by some is that language influences how we think, what we perceive, how we focus our attention, and what we
		remember. We use language to capture and share our understanding of the world around us, to communicate
		high-level goals, intentions and objectives, and to support coordination with others. Importantly, language can
		provide us with useful and purposeful abstractions that can help us to generalize and transfer knowledge to new
		situations.
		Language comes in many forms. In Computer Science and in the study of AI, we have historically used formal
		knowledge representation languages and programming languages to capture our understanding of the world and to
		communicate unambiguously with computers. In this talk I will discuss how formal language can help agents learn
		and reason with a deep dive on one particular topic – reinforcement learning. I’ll show how we can exploit the
		syntax and semantics of formal language and automata to aid in the specification of complex reward-worthy
		behavior. In doing so, formal language can help us address some of the challenges to reinforcement learning in
		settings where trustworthiness is important - such as settings where properties like safety or fairness need to
		be enforced.

		<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Biography:</h1> Sheila McIlraith is a
		Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto,
		Canada CIFAR AI Chair (Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence),
		and Associate Director and Research Lead of the Schwartz Reisman
		Institute for Technology and Society. Prior to joining U of T, McIlraith
		spent six years as a Research Scientist at Stanford University, and one
		year at Xerox PARC. McIlraith is the author of over 100 scholarly
		publications in the area of knowledge representation, automated
		reasoning and machine learning. Her work focuses on AI sequential
		decision making broadly construed, through the lens of human-compatible
		AI. McIlraith is a fellow of the ACM, a fellow of the Association for
		the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and a past President
		of KR Inc., the international scientific foundation concerned with
		fostering research and communication on knowledge representation and
		reasoning. She is currently serving on the Standing Committee of the
		Stanford One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100).
		McIlraith is an associate editor of the Journal of Artificial
		Intelligence Research (JAIR), a past associate editor of the journal
		Artificial Intelligence (AIJ), and a past board member of Artificial
		Intelligence Magazine. In 2018, McIlraith served as program co-chair of
		the 32nd AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18). She also
		served as program co-chair of the International Conference on Principles
		of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR2012), and the
		International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2004). McIlraith's early work
		on Semantic Web Services has had notable impact. In 2011 she and her
		co-authors were honoured with the SWSA 10-year Award, a test of time
		award recognizing the highest impact paper from the International
		Semantic Web Conference, 10 years prior; in 2022 McIlraith and
		co-authors were honoured with the 2022 ICAPS Influential Paper Award,
		recognizing a significant and influential paper published 10 years prior
		at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling;
		and in 2023 McIlraith and co-authors were honoured with the IJCAI-JAIR
		Best Paper Prize, awarded annually to an outstanding paper published in
		JAIR in the preceding five years.
