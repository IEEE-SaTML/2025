# SaTML website

## Getting Started

- Prerequisite: install hugo (https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) if
  you want to see and test the changes locally  (use version 0.122.0, more
  recent versions introduced breaking changes with theme used)
- Clone repository and submodules:
  - (HTTPS) `git clone --recurse-submodules
    https://github.com/IEEE-SaTML/ieee-satml.github.io.git`
  - (SSH) `git clone --recurse-submodules
    git@github.com:IEEE-SaTML/ieee-satml.github.io.git`

## Template Architecture

The theme used by the SaTML website is a
[fork](https://github.com/IEEE-SaTML/website_theme) of the [Syna
Theme](https://syna.okkur.org/docs) that has been slightly modified. The theme
is a git submodule cloned under `themes/syna`.

The file `config.toml` contains the main configurations (URL, title, favicon,
colors, menus) for the SaTML website.

The folder `content` is composed of different subfolders, each one of these
subfolders corresponds to a page of the website. A page is made up of fragments;
each fragment is defined by a Markdown file (refer to `content` for examples),
note that the `weight` attribute determines the order in which the fragments are
arranged. See the [Syna Theme
Documentation](https://about.okkur.org/syna/fragments/) for the different
fragments that are available. Fragments placed in the `_global` subfolder are
applied to every page of the website (header, foother, menu, etc.), the `_index`
subfolder corresponds to the Home page.

The folder `resources` is populated by the `hugo server -D` command when locally
building and viewing the website during development.

The folder `static` contains the favicon, images, and some custom CSS for the
website.

## Schedule

We use the following [component](https://codyhouse.co/gem/schedule-template).

Here is the corresponding README for that template:
- A simple template that lets you display events on a timeline, as well as
  organize them in groups (week days, conference rooms etcâ€¦).
- [Article on CodyHouse](https://codyhouse.co/gem/schedule-template)
- [Demo](https://codyhouse.co/demo/schedule-template)
- [License](https://codyhouse.co/license)
- This experiment is built upon the [CodyHouse
  Framework](https://github.com/CodyHouse/codyhouse-framework).
- Make sure to include both the style.scss and util.js files of the framework.
- (Added note by Yohan: .scss deleted as not needed)

The main `html` file of the schedule must be placed under `layouts` so that it
is used as a custom fragment. Then, every individual file for each session can
be placed in the corresponding folder under `content`.

## Website Deployment

* Clone this repository
* Make your edits in the template files
* View your edits locally with `hugo server -D`
* Once satisfied, commit and push your edits to Github
* At every new commit pushed to the `main` branch on Github, a Github Action is
  triggered to rebuild and redeploy the  website automatically (no need to run
  the `hugo` command yourself or create a  `public` folder anymore)


## Preparing website for new edition

We want to archive the version of the current edition that just happened and
prepare the website for the following year.

1. Let's switch to a new branch `git checkout -b 20xx`
2. Create the corresponding folders under `static` to store the new edition's
   files (`images/20xx`)/pictures (`files/20xx`)
3. Under `content` create a folder for the previous edition, copy-paste there
   the content of the `content` folder (`_index`, `accepted-papers`, ...,
   `_index.md`) except the `_global` and `past` folders.
4. For the previous edition, edit the `header.md` of the home page to include
   buttons to link to the different pages created for that edition, and then
   copy/paste the modified `header.md` in every folder for that previous
   edition, so that it appears at the top of each page (and people can navigate
   with these links)
5. Update accordingly the links on the pages, and the menu of the website to
   correctly point to previous edition where it needs to and next edition
   otherwise, remove details about previous edition that are not needed anymore.
6. Once satisfied, merge the branch on main.
